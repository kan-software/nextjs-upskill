## Getting Started

First install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Upskill API
The documentation of the API for the Xebia Next.js Upskill is available in the folder `docs` of this repository.

To read the documentation go to [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io) and paste the content of the `nextjs-api-upskill.yaml` file in the editor.

The code for the API is located in the folder `lib` of this repository. You can use it to manage your own code but this is not required.

**IMPORTANT** This API relies on internal memory, which will be erased along with a server reset.
